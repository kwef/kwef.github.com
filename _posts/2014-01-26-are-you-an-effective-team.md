**Warning:** This post contains spoilers for the movie [*Oblivion* (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/), as well as several links to that endless time-sink, [TVTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage).

Recently, I was flying home to Massachusetts after a brief sojourn in Tucson (blue skies and mountains, heavily-armed vegetation, "my god, it's full of stars"). While I was aloft swiftly homeward, I watched the movie *Oblivion* on the in-flight entertainment system. And I had a few thoughts about one of the [arc phrases](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords) of the movie.

But first, several initial notes:

- *Oblivion*'s world is populated with some really interesting and highly improbable design, specifically [the bubbleship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmUm8dG4bTI) and [the tower](http://static.dyli.sh/blog/oblivion/tower.jpg).
- *Oblivion* is really. really. sexist. It fails the [Bechdel test](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest?from=Main.TheBechdelTest) with nuclear aplomb.
- Probably the best commentary on this film comes in the form of [this brilliant parody script](http://www.the-editing-room.com/oblivion.html) by one of my favorite blogs, [The Editing Room](http://www.the-editing-room.com).
- Despite its swiss cheese plot and wax-paper characters, it somehow manages to be a pretty fun movie.

What I want to talk about, though, is a particular recurring interaction between the main characters, and the---

**I AM ABOUT TO SPOIL THE BIG REVEAL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE**

---evil alien AI, "Sally". Sally (Melissa Leo) pretends to be the protagonists' human commander, remotely located on the "Tet" space station. In actuality, the Tet is an alien craft pillaging the Earth's resources, and Jack (Tom Cruise) has been brainwashed to help the bad guys destroy the human resistance, who he believes to be alien "Scavs." How's that for a plot twist? I warned you.

But let's talk about those arc words. Almost every day, Jack's business and sexual partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) has the following interaction with Sally:

Sally: "Are you an effective team?"

Vika: "We are an effective team."
