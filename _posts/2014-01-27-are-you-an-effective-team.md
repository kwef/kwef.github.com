**Warning:** This post contains spoilers for the movie [*Oblivion* (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/), as well as several links to that endless time-sink, [TVTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage). This will be your only warning.

Recently, I was flying home to Massachusetts after a brief sojourn in Tucson (blue skies and mountains, heavily-armed vegetation, "my god, it's full of stars"). While I was aloft swiftly homeward, I watched the movie *Oblivion* on the in-flight entertainment system. In the past couple weeks, I've had several thoughts about one of the [arc phrases](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords) of the movie.

But first, initial notes:

- *Oblivion*'s world is populated with some interesting and highly improbable design, specifically [the bubbleship](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmUm8dG4bTI) and [the tower](http://static.dyli.sh/blog/oblivion/tower.jpg).
- *Oblivion* is really. really. sexist. It fails the [Bechdel test](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest?from=Main.TheBechdelTest) with nuclear aplomb.
- Probably the best commentary on this film comes in the form of [this brilliant parody script](http://www.the-editing-room.com/oblivion.html) by one of my favorite blogs, [The Editing Room](http://www.the-editing-room.com).
- Despite its swiss cheese plot and wax-paper characters, it somehow manages to be a pretty fun movie.

What I want to talk about is not the things above; rather, I want to focus on a particular recurring interaction in the film, between the humans and the evil alien AI, "Sally". Sally (Melissa Leo) is pretending to be the protagonists' human commander, remotely located on the "Tet" space station. In reality, the Tet is an alien craft pillaging the Earth's resources, and Jack (Tom Cruise) has been brainwashed to help these bad guys destroy the human resistance, who he believes to be alien "Scavs."

How's *that* for a plot twist?

But let's talk about those arc words. Almost every day, Jack's business/sexual partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) has the following conversation with Sally:

> *Sally:* "Are you an effective team?"  
> *Vika:* "We are an effective team."

Day in, day out. "Are you an effective team?" "We are an effective team." When I was watching the film, something about this dynamic struck me. I didn't know why, until I noticed myself saying the following, all the time, with *every person ever*:

> *Me:* "Hey, how are you?"  
> *Friend:* "Fine, how are you?"  
> *Me:* "Fine."

...and then we go our ways.

What happens if I'm not fine? I say I'm fine. I've been participating in a tacit understanding that one does not simply *say that one is not fine*. Here are a few socially acceptable alternatives to "I'm not fine":

- "Really busy, but doing okay."
- "Pretty tired, but I'm just fine."
- "Super stressed, but that's all right."

Admitting, *sans* euphemism, that I'm not fine sometimes feels tantamount to saying something is catastrophically wrong. But some days, an evil space tetrahedron is not draining the Earth's oceans and plotting my doom... yet nevertheless, I'm not feeling *fine*.

Here's what happens when Vika admits to Sally that she and Jack are no longer an effective team---that they are *not fine*:<br/><br/>

<object width="100%" height="320"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/rl04_HmrnYo?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/rl04_HmrnYo?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" height="320" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><br/>

Let me clarify: This is not, shall we say, a perfect metaphor. When I admit that I am not fine, I don't expect a flaming murder sphere to erupt from beneath the floorboards and start lasering without regard for my flawless future-kitchen.

But it's not a completely meaningless metaphor either. A lot of the time, I'm afraid to admit that I'm not fine, afraid that people will assume that my drapes are on fire and my world is ending, despite my protestations.

The middle ground between "fine" and "incredibly sad and extremely bad" appears to have eroded. I can feel fine, good, great, fantastic... or bad. As a result, every time I have that trivial, meaningless verbal handshake, I can't be just a little not-fine.

You know what?<br/><br/>

<object width="100%" height="320"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/qxU4XQVUvYo?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/qxU4XQVUvYo?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" height="320" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object><br/>

There needs to be room in our discourse for an entire spectrum of nuanced feelings, not just this fine/bad binary. I posit that the "How are you?" / "Fine, you?" / "Fine," exchange is causing a harmful distortion of emotional language.

This matters because empathy is the foundation of human relationships. Telepathy notwithstanding, effective empathy rests on effective communication. If a chunk of our emotional spectrum is rendered non-communicable, the matching chunk of our ability to empathize and connect, human-to-human, is likewise inaccessible.

Moreover, the rote, ritualistic nature of the "fine" exchange, the social script which predetermines that all parties are fine, always, has cheapened the power of a geniune desire to know someone's state of mind. In other words, this norm weakens our ability to geniunely inquire after one another's wellbeing, as well as for us to meaningfully respond to such queries.

**A note on cultural norms and assumptions:** I am a white male middle-class college student in the American Northeast. I'm not claiming that these types of conversations happen everywhere. Some readers may not experience this phenomenon, and I make no assumptions about the universality of my observations.

That being said, I believe that there are a lot of people for whom the "fine" conversation happens on the daily. If that is you, I urge you to eschew the grasp of this convention, to break the pattern and revivify your quotidian interactions.

A first step toward this end, I claim, is to make a radical return to emotional honesty, even in short conversations. I've been attempting, with some success (and some relapses, to be... honest), to do this myself. I'm trying to become more cognizant of when I'm operating on auto-pilot and playing back the "fine" tape, and I try to stop that in its tracks, and ask myself whether I actually am fine. Even if I could describe my state as "fine", it's always the case that a more specific description is more accurate.

I had anticipated some negative reprecussions from this policy: being met with too much sympathy I didn't want, or perhaps awkward pauses in conversation. This hasn't much happened. I think I may have overestimated the amount of social awkwardity caused by giving a truly honest answer to a quick, nonchalant query.

On the other hand, positive things *have* happened. I sometimes haven't noticed that I've got something gnawing away at my mind until I take that split second of mindfulness to introspect on my emotional landscape. Thus, everyday honesty to others has given me more room to be honest to myself/. Of equal importance, unexpected radical honesty about my life and feelings has led to some wonderful moments of connection, some with people with whom I did not expect to connect.

Radical emotional honesty, even (especially) when it seems not to be the expected response, can make a meaningful dent in the problem of socially scripted dishonesty and disconnection. By being more mindful of words and more honest about feelings, maybe our friends and ourselves can form a more effective team.
